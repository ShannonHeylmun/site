For as long as I can remember, I have used *reclaimed materials* to make things. How many garage tinkerers hoard miscelaneous garbage on the off chance its true utility reveals itself? How many times has a father/uncle/other relative or friend lamented throwing out that widget last year which is exactly what they needed to fix some gizmo?

Inspired by the [Melbourne Maker Space](https://melbournemakerspace.org), I would like to build a cross-plaform interface for folks who hate waste to share their hoard with likeminded neighbors. Goals: Help reduce materials going into landfills and help people build community.
