I'm an educator and engineer.

I live to share what I know and learn new things along the way. There is nothing more fulfilling than helping others to experience "lightbulb" moments. Having been homeschooled from 3rd grade through earning a GED, I have an unusual relationship with academics. I think my parents, despite some gaps and limitations, maintained in me a sense of childlike curiousity which often doesn't survive institutional schooling.

After *graduating highschool*, I attended the University of Florida, earning a BS in Mathematics and an MAE in Teaching Mathematics. My first dream job was to teach college-level mathematics, which I did from 2012 until 2017, when I pivoted to working mainly in mobile and web development. During my teaching career, I have only grown more passionate about the potential educational power of technology, particularly computer science.

In no particular order, my special interests include (but are in no way limited to):

- Gardening,
- Cooking,
- Animal behavior,
- World history,
- Natural languages and linguistics,
