# Designing Ergonomic APIs in Rust

[Rust](https://rustlang.org) is a [great programming language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#admired-and-desired).
It has a strong type system, memory safety, concurrency as a first class feature, a powerful macro system,
and a focus on developer productivity, in addition to being one of the fastest languages out there.
All of those attributes have been covered by too many blogs, articles, and talks to count.
The ecosystem of crates is growing rapidly,
but many of the foundational crates are of a quality that is hard to find in other languages.
Crates like [Chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono), [Tokio](https://tokio.rs), and [Hyper](https://hyper.rs) are well-designed,
well-documented, and well-maintained.
This isn't to suggest that other languages don't have great ecosystems,
but the quality of core crates in the Rust ecosystem is just on another level.
They're not just good, they're great.
They have a level of correctness, robustness, and attention to detail that is hard to find in any other language.
Moreover, there are a *lot* of examples of really incredible open source projects written in Rust.
I've been blown away by the quality of the crates I've used in Rust since I started working in the language.
The code is so good in fact, that it's honestly pretty intimidating.

I've spent the last several months building libraries in Rust,
and I've come to appreciate the sum of the language's strengths for a reason I haven't seen discussed much:
obvious correctness drives ergonomics.
Because the language is so strict, it's easy to identify where you've taken shortcuts to get things working.
Like just about everyone who's ever written code, I have taken shortcuts I regretted to make deliveries on time.
I didn't always consider carefully whether functions should take references or values.
I didn't always encode the invariants of my data structures in the type system.
I wrote some functions that were awkward to use and traits that resulted in a lot of boilerplate.
I've also been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go back and address much of that technical debt.
The results have been rather remarkable.

Simply fixing the things that were obviously lacking, I've been able to make my code more correct, robust, and simple.
I've arrived at a place where I have some pretty great ergonomics in some of the APIs I've built
just by addressing issues that were obvious shortcuts, as well as areas that caused me to take shortcuts downstream.

## What are Ergonomics?

The ergonomics of a programming language are the features that make it easy to write code.
Go, Python, and Ruby are known for their ergonomics.
They have a simple syntax, powerful standard libraries, and a focus on developer productivity.
Unfortunately, their ergonomics come at the cost of making it easy to introduce runtime errors
and structural issues that can be difficult to debug.
It's easy to develop functionality quickly in those languages,
but there tends to be a long tail of bugs and performance issues.
It's easy to get things *mostly right*,
but it's much harder to get things *exactly right*.

On the other hand, Rust has a reputation for being difficult to learn and use,
seemingly at odds with its popularity and veneration.
It has a steep learning curve, a complex type system,
and a focus on memory safety and performance that forces developers to worry about things they might not even consider in other languages.
Frustratingly, you have to consider and address all of those issues before your code will even compile.

The ergonomics of libraries are a little different.
An ergonomic library is one that is easy to use, easy to understand, and hard to misuse.
It's easy to get started with, and it's pleasant to use as intended.
Rust's strict but expressive type system allows for libraries that are both powerful and easy to use.
Well designed libraries encode their invariants in the types and functions they expose,
making it difficult to misuse them.
Thoughtful traits and macros can give users lots of power with minimal boilerplate.

## Ergonomics in Rust

The best crates in the Rust ecosystem are like a masterclass in API design.
Need to serialize a complex data structure?

[Serde](https://serde.rs) makes it easy.
```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
Struct MyComplexType{...
```

**Boom**, done.

Need to make a complicated  SQL query?
[Diesel](https://diesel.rs") has you covered.
```rust
let results =
      orders::table
      .inner_join(users::table.on(orders::user_id.eq(users::id)))
      .inner_join(order_items::table.on(order_items::order_id.eq(orders::id)))
      .filter(order_items::product_id.eq(product_id))
      .select((users::username,
          diesel::sql_function::sum(order_items::price).as(total_spent)))
      .group_by(users::username)
      .order_by(diesel::sql_function::sum(order_items::price).desc())
      .limit(10)
      .load::<(String, i32)>(conn)?;
```
**Whoa**, that's a big, complex expression that just does exactly what I want.

There are so many incredible examples of great API design in the Rust ecosystem.
Rust's standard library is the only standard library that I've ever used that I would describe as both
extremely clever and easily readable.
Clever code tends to be dense and opaque,
but Rust's standard library is ingenious because its abstractions are so simple and powerful.

The Rustaceans that really drive the ecosystem write an unbelievable ammount of code of incredibly high quality code.
I've never understood quite how they do it.
Having the opportunity to spend the time to really polish Rust code myself has given me some insight though.
The key is to just keep fixing the things that are obviously wanting,
and the language itself helps guide you to something exceptional.

## What's Wrong?

The Rust language is very specific.
Very little is implicit.
If you want to copy something, you have to call `.clone()`.
If you get an error, you have to explicitly handle it (or call `.unwrap()` ðŸ¤®).
If you've coded yourself into a corner with the borrow checker,
you have to refactor your code to fix your access patterns.

Fortunately, it's pretty easy to make sweeping changes in Rust for the same reasons that writing it in the first place is difficult.
The compiler catches cases where you've made a mistake or missed something that needs to be updated.
The result is that once a major refactor compiles again, the code probably works as intended.
The compiler is very particular, but it has your back, and it's a great feeling.

The specificity of the language does tend to awaken the perfectionist in many developers:
- "I shouldn't need to clone that here, I should be able to pass a reference."
- "I shouldn't need to unwrap that here, I should be able to handle the error."
- "I shouldn't need to write that boilerplate, I should be able to use a macro."
- "I should be able to prevent that mistake from happening in the first place."

This can result in a lot of revisiting code that works, but isn't quite perfect.
Many of the deficiencies described above are so subtle in other languages that even experienced developers might overlook them.
In Rust, they're glaringly obvious.

This is a double edged sword, of course.
- It's easy to get lost in the weeds of perfectionism
- It's also Rust's superpower

## Fixing the Obvious

The API examples above weren't this good in their first release, or their second, or their tenth.
Their authors made them work, and then they made them better.
They are great examples of what can be accomplished with a lot of time, effort, and dedication.
The crates that are incredible works of engineering today have stood the test of time.
They have fixed the papercuts reported by thousands of users.
Issues that they never considered when writing their libraries have been reported and fixed.
They have been polished to a mirror sheen and are a joy to use because
so many of the things that were obviously wanting in previous iterations have been addressed.
Someone already found the rough edges that you were going to run into,
and either fixed the issue themselves, or reported the issue to the authors who did.
Sometimes fixing the issue was easy, and sometimes it was hard.
Sometimes it required a major refactor, and sometimes it required building a whole other library.
Sometimes it required working with the language team itself to fix bugs or introduce new language features.
The unifying factor is that the authors were dedicated to making their code better,
and the language gave them the tools to do so.
Developers want to make their code better in every language.
Rust isn't unique in that regard, but it is unique in how it guides developers to identify where and how to make their code better.

The result is that many crates in the Rust ecosystem are a joy to use.
It's not just because the authors are genius programmers (many of them are).
It's because they've spent the time to address areas that were flawed over and over again.
You don't have to be a world famous open source developer to write great code in Rust.
You just have to be willing to fix the things that can obviously be improved until you've built something incredible.
